	ABSTRACT
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction using data provided by Google Finance. By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

	INTRODUCTION
1.1. OVERVIEW
Stock Market Data Analysis is intended exclusively for analyzing the data of stock market for various organization. Using this type of data analysis any organization can get the stock related information in an easy way.

1.2. AIM OF THE PROJECT
The main aim of my project is to analyze the data of any organization in any format we require.
	TECHNOLOGIES

2.1. ABOUT PYTHON
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

	TOOLS

3.1. NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
a powerful N-dimensional array object
sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

3.2. Pandas
Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
pandas is a NumFOCUS sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project, and makes it possible to donate to the project.


3.3. MATPLOTLIB
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI	tool-kits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL),designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of matplotlib.


	SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT

4.1. Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet. In addition to displaying/editing/running notebook documents, the Jupyter Notebook App has a “Dashboard” (Notebook Dashboard), a “control panel” showing local files and allowing to open notebook documents or shutting down their kernels.

	PROBLEMS FOR THE ANALYSIS
•	Import the financial data using quandl for the following companies:
•	Apple
•	Amazon
•	Microsoft
•	Google
•	Perform fundamental data analysis
•	Fetch the last one year’s data
•	View the values of Apple’s stock
•	Display the plot of closing price
•	Display the stock trade by volume
•	Plot all companies’ data together for closing price
•	Perform Daily Return Analysis and show the relationship between different stocks
•	Plot the percentage change plot for Apple’s stock
•	Show a joint plot for Apple and Google
•	Use Pair Plot to show the correlation between all the stocks
•	Perform risk analysis

	CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

We evaluated two Fundamental Analysis metrics and found no conclusive proof of their predictive value.
These predictions are also very long term, looking one year into the future. Predictions on this time scale are not the focus of the project. Instead we will focus on predicting daily trends in the market. Due to these issues that we moved away from Fundamental Analysis.
